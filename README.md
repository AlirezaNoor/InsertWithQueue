**Title: InsertWithQueue**

**Description:**

The "InsertWithQueue" scenario demonstrates an efficient way to insert multiple entities of different types into a database using a queue. In this approach, entities of various classes are added to a single queue (`Queue<object>`), allowing for the dynamic processing of different entity types. By leveraging polymorphism and runtime type checking, objects are dequeued and inserted into the appropriate Entity Framework Core `DbSet` based on their actual type.

**Key Components:**

1. **Queue:** A generic queue (`Queue<object>`) is utilized to hold objects of various entity types. Objects are enqueued into this data structure, creating a unified storage mechanism for diverse entities.

2. **Entity Classes:** Multiple entity classes (e.g., `EntityA`, `EntityB`, `EntityC`) are defined, each representing a different database entity with its unique set of properties.

3. **DbContext:** An Entity Framework Core `DbContext` is established, incorporating individual `DbSet` properties for each entity type, enabling the objects to be mapped and stored in the corresponding database tables.

4. **Polymorphism and Runtime Type Checking:** The `is` keyword is employed for runtime type checking, allowing the system to discern the actual type of dequeued objects. Depending on the object's type, it is inserted into the appropriate `DbSet` within the context, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

**Usage:**

Objects of different entity types are added to the queue and processed sequentially. Upon dequeuing, the system examines the object's type and inserts it into the corresponding database table. This approach offers flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, making it particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous data that needs to be persisted efficiently.
